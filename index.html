            <p id="" class="text-primary heading"> Social media has been one of the most prominent inventions in our human society till date. People have come to depend on social media for, well, everything. Whether it be what is happening in the world, or well whether it be something small such as a cooking recipe, social media hosts all. We as humans made social media, in the hope of making it a global platform which fulfills the small needs we as humans need in a technological society, and society did do so. It helped many people in adapting to this age, but there are always consequences for everything and though social media helps us and our brain in many cases it takes control of it.  </p>

                   <p class="heading">The negative aspects of social media:
The long-term effects of social media use (good, bad, or moderate) are not well understood because social media is a relatively new technology. However, a number of studies have discovered a clear association between frequent use of social media and a higher risk of conditions including melancholy, anxiety, loneliness, self-harm, and even suicidal ideation.
<br>
<br>                     
Inadequacy about your life or appearance:
 Even if you know that the images you’re viewing on social media are manipulated, they can still make you feel insecure about how you look or what’s going on in your own life. This can lead to you feeling pressure about your appearance. 
 <br>
<br>
Cyberbullying:
On social media, about 10% of teenagers report being bullied and many other users get nasty comments on their posts. Twitter, Instagram and many other social media platforms may serve as hubs for spreading false rumours which can cause long lasting emotional scars that can lead to you feeling pressurised for harming yourself. 
<br>
<br>                      
Self-absorption:
Social media may lead to unhealthy self-centeredness and keep you disconnected from real-life relationships if you post countless selfies and all of your private thoughts there.

                        <p class="text-muted text-danger heading"> Social media has been associated with the disease called FOMO (Fear of missing out). Essentially, FOMO is checking your phone every minute and clicking on the notification bar which comes on your phone, most times you don’t even control it and it happens so that your body does it by itself, as if it needs it and can’t live without it. If this is not how social media controls your brain what is?.

                        <p class="text-muted text-warning heading"> Unfortunately, many times the people using these platforms aren’t exactly the best people to interact with. In fact, there have been many cases where people have been bullying other people on the same platform and since billions of people have been using these social media platforms that case has been prominent and undetectable.

With the increase of FOMO people tend to spend less time with other people and more time with their phone, theri social real life is decimated. When there finally comes a time when these people start talking to other people, there might be a case where they are unable to talk with them properly (social anxiety). </p>

                <h2 class="text-capitalize btn-warning">How is this related to everything</h2>
                <p id="explanation">
   
                    Social media usage increases when you're lonely, unhappy, nervous, or stressed out because it helps you pass the time or feel connected to others.
                    <br>
                    <br>
But more frequent use of social media worsens FOMO and emotions of inferiority, discontentment, and loneliness.
                    <br>
                    <br>
These emotions then have a detrimental impact on your disposition and exacerbate depressive, anxious, and stress-related symptoms.
                    <br><br>
You use social media more as a result of these deteriorating symptoms, which feeds the vicious cycle.
                    <br><br>
<br> 
<br>
   Social media affects the body because it triggers a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is a hormone. Dopamine is responsible for allowing you to feel pressure, satisfaction and motivation. A study connected in the UK states that you feel motivated when you have done something extra-ordinary or something your happy from because of the hormone(Dopamine). Oxytocin is a natural hormone that also affects aspects of human behaviour. Oxytocin affects social memory in multiple brain regions, including the olfactory bulb(A rounded mass of tissue that contains several types of nerve cells). Many other studies suggest the potential of oxytocin to also promote prosocial behaviours and enhance social cognition in humans. If we talk about the discipline psychology, oxytocin plays a huge part in that subject and in the brain as stated above. Social media takes control of your brain and makes you be on your phone 24/7 making your brain dead and unable to function properly. All and All, social media has a big affect on the subjects and our disciplines Biology and Psychology and these affects have been very consequential on our future generations.
